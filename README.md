## Basic Keylogger Project
This Python project provides a basic keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes using the pynput library and presents a user interface with Tkinter. The application logs all keystrokes to a file, including regular and special keys, with timestamp information for each entry.

# Features

1. **Keystroke Logging:** Captures every keystroke made, including regular text and special keys like 'Esc', 'Shift', etc.

2. **File Output:** Logs all keystrokes with timestamps in a text file named keylog.txt, allowing for easy monitoring and analysis.

3. **Control Interface:** A simple GUI built with Tkinter that allows the user to start and stop the keylogger.

# Technical Details
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Toolkit:** Tkinter
- **Keylogging Library:** pynput, which monitors and logs keyboard events.
- **Logging:** Utilizes Pythonâ€™s built-in logging module to handle the logging of keystrokes securely and efficiently.
- **Threading:** Uses Python's threading to run the keylogging process in the background, ensuring that the GUI remains responsive.

# Installation and Usage
**Prerequisites**
Ensure Python is installed on your system, along with the pynput library. If not already installed, you can install pynput using pip:

pip install pynput
Running the Keylogger
Clone this repository.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.

# Run the script:
python keylogger.py
Use the GUI buttons to start and stop the keylogger.
Ethical Considerations
This tool is designed strictly for educational purposes and should be used in a manner that respects privacy laws and regulations. Here are some guidelines for using this keylogger:

- **Consent:** Never use the keylogger to capture keystrokes without the explicit consent of the individuals being monitored.
- **Transparency:** Ensure that all individuals affected by the keylogging are fully aware of the monitoring activities.
- **Legality:** Follow all local, state, and federal laws regarding surveillance and privacy.
